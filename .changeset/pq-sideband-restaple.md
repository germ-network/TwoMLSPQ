Retain the PQ side-band's in-flight frame so a host can re-send it.

A side-band frame is the only carrier of its PQ half, and until now it was handed
out once: `pq_take_pending_outbound` consumed the slot, and initiator frames
(`pq_ratchet_begin` / `pq_bootstrap_begin` / `pq_rekey_begin`) were returned
without being parked at all. A frame lost in transport therefore had nowhere to
be re-sent from, and the round stalled with no way to heal — `pq_inflight` blocks
a re-begin, and nothing can re-emit an ephemeral's public half.

The A.3 bind is the sharp case, and `pq_ratchet_bind`'s own comment describes the
hole without closing it: the bind's classical commit re-staples on message frames,
but the peer cannot apply that staple without the PQ commit riding the bind, so
the classical stream stalls retriably "until the BIND lands" — forever, if the
bind is gone. A.4 is worse: a lost KP' means the session never reaches full
establishment.

Both roles' frames are now retained in `pending_pq_outbound` (already archived,
so retention survives restore), replaced when this side produces the round's next
frame and cleared when its part in the round completes. This mirrors
`current_staple`, which has always re-sent the classical commit on every frame so
that any single received frame heals the peer.

- **New `pq_pending_outbound()`** — the frame, sealed fresh, without consuming it.
  Prefer it over `pq_take_pending_outbound` (retained, and still correct for hosts
  driving a strict request/response). A pure read: no `state_seq` bump, nothing to
  persist. Each call re-seals under the current PQ header epoch with a fresh random
  nonce, so a frame retained across a ratchet still opens.
- **New `DuplicateSideBand` error** — the PQ analogue of `DuplicateWelcome`.
  Re-sending makes duplicates steady-state traffic: an initiator's terminal frame
  has no inbound of its own to retire it, so it re-sends until the peer opens the
  next round. Receivers now classify a frame for a step already taken as a
  discardable duplicate rather than `SessionNotReady`, which a host must stay free
  to read as a routing signal. Raised only where the state proves the step is done;
  a merely ill-timed frame still reports `SessionNotReady`. These guards already
  sat above the persist choke point, so a duplicate remains a true no-op.
- **Operation guards key on turn and `pq_inflight`, not slot occupancy** — under
  retention an occupied slot is the steady state, not "busy". The gates are
  unchanged in effect: `pq_inflight` already rejected a double-respond or a bind
  without the ephemeral.

Hosts that keep using `pq_take_pending_outbound` are unaffected: initiator frames
are still returned as before, and taking still consumes.
